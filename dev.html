        <p>The first week was mostly spent onboarding all of the international members and going over basic organisational sticking points. Once the theme was announced (Leaps and Bounds) we spent the weekend deliberating what kind of game we would make. We coded the basic movement using free assets from the Unity store while Torin started work on the main character model. Audio team started work on SFX and music.</p>

        <p>The second week saw a lot of iteration on the audio and look of the game. The gliding mechanic was coded in. We also hit our first roadblock: slope behavior. The character would not slide correctly off of slopes that were too steep. We also decided to drop combat in favor of making a more cohesive game by the end of the jam. Team spirits were high.</p>

        <p>The main character finally started taking shape and got implemented in the game. A lot of time was spent fine-tuning the animation controller and animation transitions. We switched from line raycasts to spherecasts and solved most of the slope behavior. The final versions of the main sfx and music were implemented. We took on an additional team member (Kylen) but she ended up getting sick). In general a lot of team members were having personal issues and development slowed</p>

        <p>The last week was a frantic crunch to get a level made and implemented in the game. Markus was the only member who could consistently work on the game at this point, as all others had a variety of circumstances. A lot of time was spent getting the lighting dialed in using HDRP. The gamejam ended on Dec 1.</p>
